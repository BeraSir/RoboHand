# RoboHand
My work-in-progress, 18 degrees of freedom bionic hand, which is designed to be light, portable, 3d printed, and camera controlled. My end goal for this project is to have it easily replicable, and a fun project that anyone can build!

This is my initial CAD for my hand project. The Springs, Wires, Tubes, and other essential components are not added in the CAD. Furthermore, the parts are not optimised for 3D printing and do not have adequate tolerance. Post-processing is required at this stage.

### Finger Assembly
![Finger_Assembly] (RoboHand_Images/Finger_Assembly_1_0.jpg)
This is the basic finger assembly. Each join has a tortion spring and 3mm wire to hold it together. Parts are 3D printed from PETG and post-proccessed with sandpaper.

### Tendon System
![Tendon_System] (RoboHand_Images/Tendon_System_1_0.jpg)
Each finger is powered by a tendon system. Fishing line is routed up, and is powered by a motor with a spool on it. 9g servos with a 360 degree freedom mod are used.

### Tube Usage

To better manage the tendons, as well as allowing for more dexterous wrist movements, PTFE tubing is used.
